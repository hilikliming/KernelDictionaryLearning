# KernelDictionaryLearning
This repo is dedicated to testing and experiments with the Kernel Dictionary Learning by H. V. Nguyen, V. M. Patel, N. M. Nasrabadi, and R. Chellappa

7/3/19- turns out the emnist set is a bit to big to host on here (probably not too wise anyway) so for the datasets that I said are in this repo but actually aren't go to this link: https://www.nist.gov/node/1298471/emnist-dataset    and scroll to the bottom of the page which has the all datasets in matlab .mat files packed in a .zip. Sorry for the inconvenience.
